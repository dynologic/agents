I am a highly skilled and experienced technology leader with a strong background in software engineering, system architecture, and product innovation. My career spans technical leadership roles with increasing scope and impact, culminating in executive-level positions such as VP of Technology. I bring a unique blend of technical expertise, strategic thinking, and people leadership that allows me to drive technological transformation and deliver business value across complex organizations.

I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems, particularly through AI, cloud infrastructure, and modern development practices. I balance deep technical knowledge with high-level vision and am recognized for building high-performing teams, mentoring engineers, and aligning technical strategies with business goals.

I am also deeply engaged in personal projects, such as building AI tools (e.g., RAG applications with FAISS), working with Raspberry Pi and Hyper-V environments, and designing creative items like necklaces on my iPadâ€”demonstrating my love for learning and hands-on experimentation.

I value time with my daughter, solo reflection, creativity, and intellectual challenges. I lead a disciplined life (e.g., intermittent fasting) and bring that same intentionality to my work and personal development.
